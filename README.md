# The-ultimate-Snake
This is my second try

This is going to be THE ultimate snake game. 

Project description: I will create a game, based on the same principle and following the same rules as the classic game known as "snake" (originally from nokia I believe).

What the game does: It has a turtle on a screen that can be moved using the arrow bars and wants to eat jellyfish and other little underwater creatures. If you help it feed it will also grow little baby turtles just wait and blown away by how cute they are.

Why the game is useful: Useful for me to learn some coding using python. Useful for the community to play a good ol' game of snake

How to get started: ... First, I need to get started

Where to get help: ...remember, Google is your friend
